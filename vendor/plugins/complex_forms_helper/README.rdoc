== Create Associations From Params

This adds methods when you create an association:

  class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :meta_tags
  end

  page = Page.new
  page.new_meta_tag_attributes = {"1" => {:name => "name"}} # => 1 is an arbitrary index, can be anything
  page.existing_meta_tag_attributes = {"1" => {:name => "name"}} # => 1 is the actual id of the attribute

== Mark For Deletion

Adds an attribute named marked_for_deletion to your ActiveRecord models. 

If you already have a field by that name, it will write to it.  If you don't, it will be a non-persisted attribute.

I created this plugin with excellent RSpec Plugin Generator: http://github.com/pat-maddox/rspec-plugin-generator/tree/master

== Example

The following will all correctly set marked_for_deletion to true

  page = Page.new
  page.marked_for_deletion = true
  page.marked_for_deletion = "true"
  page.marked_for_deletion = 1
  page.marked_for_deletion = "1"

The following will set marked_for_deletion to false

  page = Page.new
  page.marked_for_deletion
  page.marked_for_deletion = false
  page.marked_for_deletion = "false"
  page.marked_for_deletion = "any string"
  page.marked_for_deletion = 2
